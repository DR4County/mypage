		<h3 class="small-header">How I started Programming.</h3>
		<p>
        I started playing around with making websites in 2018, using inspect element to
        see how things worked and reacted to each other. In early 2019, I then
        started using a drag and drop javascript game engine called
        <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu" title="Visit Scratch.mit.edu"
          >Scratch</a>
        to make very basic web games. Eventually I found youtube tutorials on
        how to make a basic website with html and css in 2020 and made A few
        very simple personal websites. In late 2020 I learned how to use most of
        javascript, and started to learn Node.js along with how web servers
        worked. My first Node.js project had been a very basic forum board to
        send messages on. After that I wanted to make something bigger and
        better, so I took on the challenge that is creating a fully functional
        social media. Lately, I have also started making other small games with
        engines such as Godot and Unity to expand my knowledge on how
        programming languages work and are interpreted.
		</p>

      <br />

		<h3 class="small-header">More About Me</h3>
		<p>
        I chose to learn programming and game development so I could take a
        working concept like a social media (facebook, reddit, twitter, etc.),
        and take all of the good parts that I like out of it. Then I could use
        those concepts to make my own similar yet completely different program
        or service that can benefit the users. My goal is to do this without
        bringing the downsides from the similar programs and services with it.
        While doing so I also do my best to add features that myself or others
        could benefit or want from since no other content platform or video game
        services provide it.
		</p>

      <br />

		<h3 class="small-header">What I do in my spare time.</h3>
		<p>
        I used to often play video games with friends or watch youtube videos to
        pass the time. I quickly grew bored of this and decided that since I can
        make my own video games or make videos and tutorials, I would use some
        of the things I learned to be more productive and resourceful, rather
        than just playing a game that benefits me in almost no way at all.
